/*!
 * datepicker.css, included with the date popup module, does not play well with
 * the css provided by jquery ui. Basically, it breaks it. So, we add this blank
 * file in as a theme file and let drupal_get_css() treat this as a theme
 * override which stops the file from date popup from loading.
